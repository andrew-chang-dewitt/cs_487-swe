## agenda

last lecture ([notes available here](./0113-intro/)) we covered a
macro-view of _what_ software engineering methodologies are. this
lecture covers _why_ they matter.

in the process, we'll answer some questions:

- what is the purpose of software?
- how does an entity become aware (what is intelligence)?
- what is a risk or exception?
- what makes a software project successful?
- what stops a software project from being successful?
- what differentiates software engineering from...?

## what is the purpose of software?

ideally, software enables a machine to do something
faster/cheaper/better than we humans could do it. it _automates_ away
the tedium of repetitive tasks.

we started this process w/ the industrial revolution, quickly finding
machines were bad at handling _**exceptions**_ (the unexpected),
changing situations/requirements, and nuance.

software has greatly improved on the ability of machines to handle
these difficulties; however, they are still far from perfect.

## how does an entity become aware (what is intelligence)?

part of what makes humans better at handling those things is that we
have true _intelligence_ (or awareness). as of late, there is much buzz
around AI & how it can possibly handle more nuance/changes/etc. like
humans do; however, what truely means some entity is _**aware**_?

some key traits of awareness:

- understanding of situation; can put a problem into context & grasp
  the intricacies
- ability to predict future state
- ability to learn from history/current events

## what is a risk or exception?

all software (AI or not) exists in a world with _**risks**_ (a threat
to success) & experiences _**exceptions**_ (deviations from the
expected). a critical trait of _good_ software is the ability to handle
both.

## what makes a software project successful?

to better understand risks, we must first define what makes a software project a success:

- _**scope**_&mdash;it completes the requirements
- _**quality**_&mdash;it produces good results in fulfilling scope
- _**usable**_&mdash;end-users find it easy to use & helpful
- _**efficient**_&mdash;it uses resources minimally
- _**dependable**_&mdash;it can be assumed that it will work, even in
  the face of security threats & exceptional events
- _**maintainable**_&mdash;it is easy to find & fix flaws, add
  features, move to new systems, etc.

## what stops a software project from being successful?

so now, what are some risks to software success?

- many inter-dependent layers; often found w/ poor standardization of
  behaviours at boundaries & difficulty holding layer "owners"
  responsible
- the incredible pace of change/growth in tech
- the poor ability of users/designers/programmers to actually
  understand what a user needs
- the rapid change in user needs
- the common desire to build something from scratch, even if it already
  exists

## what differentiates software engineering from...

- ... computer science?

  CS is the _theory_ of computing/software/programming languages/etc.
  SWE is the _practice_ of building software using the products of CS.
  like physics vs. electrical/mechanical/etc. engineering.

- ... systems engineering?

  software is but an element of a larger system; systems engineering
  puts those elements together while SWE focuses on the individual
  elements.
