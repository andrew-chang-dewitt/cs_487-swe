## administrivia

for my purposes, I'll be collecting all course materials (including
these notes) at a single git repository, made available on GitHub at
[https://github.com/andrew-chang-dewitt/cs_487-swe](https://github.com/andrew-chang-dewitt/cs_487-swe).

### objectives

this semester we will explore swe as a discipline, covering processes
used to do the job well, seek to understand the importance of these
processes in relation to CS, seek to understand the role of these
processes in relation to business needs & societal needs, become
proficient in these processes, & explore related ethical issues.

### about prof. Dennis Hood

background as swe, moved into teaching swe methods, sw quality, user-centered
design, & more

see syllabus for contact, office hours, etc.

### materials

- _Software Engineering (10th Edition)_, Ian Sommerville (2016)
- additional articles/papers/etc. as needed posted to Canvas

### grading

categories:

- _**20% engagement/participation**_

  this is composed of lecture attendance & small "engagement assignments".

- _**20% hw**_

  4 assignements spaced throught the semester, completed individually.

- _**20% team design project**_

  completed in assigned teams utilizing techniques described in
  lecture/readings to design a swe project. prof advised that some
  LLM/generative AI can be used in this to align w/ modern work
  expectations for many SWE organizations. he stressed being careful on
  how it is used & against blindly trusting it. suggested it might be
  most useful near the end of the project in assisting at creating a
  working prototype based on the design.

- _**15% individual term paper**_

  a case study of some software engineering project. a "draft" (prof
  calls it a "framework") is due midway through the semester.prof
  explicitly warned against using LLMs for this.

- _**10% midterm**_
- _**15% final**_

  both midterm & final will be closed book & in person.

scale:

prof seems to be reluctant to give As, spoke fitting to a bell curve.
scale will be adjusted to help fit this curve, typically resulting in
pulling the lower limit for an A down a little bit from the starting
point of 90%.

### lecture approach

notes will be posted Monday week of & it is expected that we read
before lecture on Tuesday/Thursday. lecture is intended to be a more of

a time for discussion & less of a time for downloading information from
slides to memory.
